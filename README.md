# Useful-python-scripts-ive-coded
This is a script i made with a team. It is a universal mute switch, no matter what you are doing when the f1 key is pressed you will be muted until f1 is pressed again
Please credit me if you use this, it is open source so you can edit it if you wish, but again make sure to credit me when you use/change this script
